The First Project from Volunteer-H


I am Hoi Kiu Ho, born on the twenty-forth of June, 2009.

Currenty, I like fighting, maths, Greek, and a whole lot of things.

I would describe my personality as violent, smart, cunning and a bit insane.

This is not a joke. My favorite person is Hades, god of the underworld, in the greek gods. 

Look into my recent behaviour, and I am sure you understand why.
